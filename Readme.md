# dotfiles

These are the configuration files I use on my computer. I've collected them
here to make it easier to sync them between machines. Additionally, I think
they will be useful to others crafting their own setups.

## Install

1. First, install [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/stow.html).
I do this via [homebrew](http://brew.sh). If you know of a BSD-licensed
alternative to GNU Stow, let me know on

2. Clone this repository into your home directory
2. `cd` into the `dotfiles` directory
3. Run `stow APPNAME` to install the configuration files for that app
